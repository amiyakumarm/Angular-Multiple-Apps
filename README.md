## Generate angular library

ng generate library my-library
Remember to run upcoming commands from your workspace folder.
This command creates an angular library and makes an entry in angular.json which is generated previously.
All the applications and library created will be placed under the projects folder in the workspace.
It creates entry for library under projects key. Important keys are
"projectType" is library
"root" is path to library folder
"sourceRoot" is src folder path in your library
"architect" property holds an configuration object for build, test and lint.

All this is for the library in the project.
Other important commands
ng build my-library --prod // build production version of the library 
ng build my-library --watch // watch for any changes in library and build after changes are saved
